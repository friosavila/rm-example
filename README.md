Edit file code/01-setup.do, and change the path for -root-

Then run the files in the following order:

1. code/01-setup.do
2. code/02-cleaning.do
3. code/03-analysis.do

The tables generated require minor adjustments. 
For example, results/tables/reg1.md is directly produced by Stata, 
but results/tables/reg1_edit.md is used in the final document.
