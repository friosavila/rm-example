## Welcome to Magical Econometrics

In this enchanting course, we shall master:

- The Ordinary Least Squares Charm
- Defense Against the Dark Arts of Heteroskedasticity
- Transfiguration of Variables

---

## The OLS Charm

Behold, the magical incantation:

::: {.spell}
Ordinary Leastus Squarius: Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε
:::

Where:
- Y is our dependent variable
- X is our independent variable
- ε is the error term, representing magical interference

---

## Data from the Triwizard Tournament

::: {.adjust}
| Year | Wizard Performance | Wand Length | Dragon Ferocity |
|------|---------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| 1994 | 85 points           | 11 inches   | 7               |
| 1995 | 92 points           | 13 inches   | 5               |
| 1996 | 78 points           | 10 inches   | 8               |

## Casting the Analysis Spell

```r
model <- lm(wizard_performance ~ wand_length + dragon_ferocity, data = triwizard_data)
summary(model)
```

---

## Interpreting the Prophecy

::: {.magical-box}
For every inch increase in wand length, wizard performance increases by 3 points, assuming dragon ferocity remains constant.
