## The Art of Econometrics

In this grand quest, we shall uncover:

- The mystical OLS incantation
- Prophecies of heteroskedasticity
- Battling the dragon of endogeneity

---

## The OLS Spell

Behold, the sacred formula:

::: {.formula}
Y = β₀ + β₁X + ε
:::

Where:
- Y is our dependent variable
- X is our independent variable
- ε is the error term, representing the whims of fate

---

## Data from the Royal Census

::: {.adjust}
| Year | Grain Yield | Rainfall | Dragon Attacks |
|------|-------------|----------|----------------|
| 1200 | 1000 bushels| 25 inches| 3              |
| 1201 | 1200 bushels| 30 inches| 2              |
| 1202 | 800 bushels | 20 inches| 5              |
:::

## The Scribe's Calculation

```r
model <- lm(grain_yield ~ rainfall + dragon_attacks, data = royal_census)
summary(model)
```

---

## Interpreting the Prophecy

::: {.medieval-box}
For every inch of rainfall, grain yield increases by 40 bushels, assuming dragon attacks remain constant.

## Conclusion

- We have unveiled the mysteries of OLS
- Rainfall brings bounty, dragons bring ruin
- May your R-squared be ever high and your p-values low
