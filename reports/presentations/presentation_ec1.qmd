## Introduction

- Human capital investments and labor market outcomes
- Focus on education and work experience
- Heterogeneity across wage distribution and genders
- Implications for policy and labor market understanding

## Research Questions

1. What are the current returns to education and experience?
2. How do these returns vary across the wage distribution?
3. To what extent do gender differences persist?
4. How do other factors interact with these returns?

## Data and Methodology

- Sample of 1,647 individuals
- Key variables: wages, education, experience, demographics
- Methods:
  - OLS regression
  - Quantile regression
  - Gender-specific analyses

## Key Findings: Returns to Education and Experience

- Education: 8.1% increase in wages per year
- Experience: 3.8% increase per year, diminishing returns
- Quantile effects:
  - Education: Stronger impact at lower wage levels
  - Experience: Highest returns at 25th percentile

## Gender Differences

|-------------------|:---------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| Yrs of education  | 0.081***  | 0.057***  | 0.098***  |
|                   |  (0.007)  |  (0.009)  |  (0.010)  |

| Married           |   0.004   | 0.132***  | -0.155**  |
|                   |  (0.033)  |  (0.036)  |  (0.055)  |


## Key Findings: Gender Differences

- Higher returns to education for women (9.8% vs 5.7%)
- Higher returns to experience for women (6.2% vs 3.0%)
- Persistent gender wage gap (-19.8%)
- Marriage effect: 
  - Positive for men (+13.2%)
  - Negative for women (-15.5%)

## Implications

- Continued importance of education and experience
- Need for targeted interventions at different wage levels
- Persistent gender disparities require nuanced approaches
- Importance of work-family policies

## Conclusions

- Education and experience remain crucial for wages
- Heterogeneous effects across wage distribution
- Complex gender dynamics in returns to human capital
- Future research: mechanisms, occupational differences, temporal changes
